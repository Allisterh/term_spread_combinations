# term_spread_combinations
In this project, I show how diff􏰎erent combinations and components of term spread have varying shapes, which can be analyzed in order to understand movements in the economy. Calculating term spread dispersion can help us better price risk in the bond market. Term spread combinations have varying power in explaining future movements in macro variable. It shows that the spanning hypothesis of the term spread against a macro variable might hold true depending on the combination and component of term spread that we are taking into consideration. This project provides a mechanism through which we can identify the best combination of a term spread for creating an efficient􏰐 macro 􏰍finance model.
