# Term Spread Combinations: Its ability to Span different Macro-economic variables and explain their future movements.

In this project, I show how different combinations and components of term spread have varying shapes, 
which can be analyzed in order to understand movements in the economy. Calculating term spread dispersion 
can help us better price risk in the bond market. Term spread combinations have varying power in explaining future 
movements in macro variable. It shows that the spanning hypothesis of the term spread against a macro variable might
hold true depending on the combination and component of term spread that we are taking into consideration. 
This project provides a mechanism through which we can identify the best combination of a term spread for creating an 
efficient macro finance model.
